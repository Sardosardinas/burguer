# burguer

This homework is for you to use handlebars, and it's kind of difficult, but I recommend you get a piece of paper and start drawing the information flowing. Or put information like

My database is called "burger_db", and the table is called "burgers".

With your piece of paper, draw the structure of this project.

So the code moves from the database to the ORM and the connections, then it moves to the models and the views (handlebars), to finally show the information in the public assets (html, css and js).

The most important thing is the connection in XAMPP running, it should look like this

And from there start looking the code in the ORM and connection, inside the config folder.

It helps that you have the database with information, you can check mine if necessary.

The outcome in console when running looks like this.

Have fun!
